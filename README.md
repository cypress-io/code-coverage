# @cypress/code-coverage [![renovate-app badge][renovate-badge]][renovate-app] [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/code-coverage.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cypress-io/code-coverage)

> Saves the code coverage collected during Cypress tests

## Install

```shell
npm install -D @cypress/code-coverage
```

Note: this plugin assumes `cypress` is a peer dependency already installed in your project.

Add to your `cypress/support/index.js` file

```js
import '@cypress/code-coverage/support'
```

Register tasks in your `cypress/plugins/index.js` file

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/task')(on, config)
  
  // add other tasks to be registered here
  
  // IMPORTANT to return the config object
  // with the any changed environment variables
  return config
}
```

## Instrument your application

This plugin **DOES NOT** instrument your code. You have to instrument it yourself using [Istanbul.js](https://istanbul.js.org/) tool. Luckily it is not difficult. For example, if you are already using Babel to transpile you can add [babel-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) to your `.babelrc` and instrument on the fly.

```
{
  "plugins": ["istanbul"]
}
```

Please see the [Examples](#examples) section down below, you can probably find a linked project matching your situation to see how to instrument your application's source code before running end-to-end tests to get the code coverage.

If your application has been instrumented correctly, then you should see additional counters and instructions in the application's JavaScript resources, like the image down below shows.

![Instrumented code](images/instrumented-code.png)

You should see the `window.__coverage__` object in the "Application under test iframe"

![Window coverage object](images/window-coverage-object.png)

If you have instrumented your application's code and see the `window.__coverage__` object, then this plugin will save the coverage into `.nyc_output` folder and will generate reports after the tests finish (even in the interactive mode). Find the LCOV and HTML report in the `coverage/lcov-report` folder.

![Coverage report](images/coverage.jpg)

That should be it! You should see messages from this plugin in the Cypress Command Log

- Watch [Code coverage](https://youtu.be/C8g5X4vCZJA) webinar

### App vs unit tests

You need to instrument your web application. This means that when the test does `cy.visit('localhost:3000')` any code the `index.html` requests should be instrumented by YOU. See [Examples](#examples) section for advice, usually you need to stick `babel-plugin-istanbul` into your pipeline somewhere.

If you are testing individual functions from your application code by importing them directly into Cypress spec files, this is called "unit tests" and Cypress can instrument this scenario for you. See [Instrument unit tests](#instrument-unit-tests) section.

## Reports

The `coverage` folder has results in several formats, and the coverage raw data is stored in `.nyc_output` folder. You can see the coverage numbers yourself. This plugin has `nyc` as a dependency, so it should be available right away. Here are common examples:

```shell
# see just the coverage summary
$ npx nyc report --reporter=text-summary
# see just the coverage file by file
$ npx nyc report --reporter=text
# save the HTML report again
$ npx nyc report --reporter=lcov
```

It is useful to enforce [minimum coverage](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#common-configuration-options) numbers. For example:

```shell
$ npx nyc report --check-coverage --lines 80
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
File      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
 main.js  |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------

$ npx nyc report --check-coverage --lines 101
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
File      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
 main.js  |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
ERROR: Coverage for lines (100%) does not meet global threshold (101%)
```

## Instrument unit tests

If you test your application code directly from `specs` you might want to instrument them and combine unit test code coverage with any end-to-end code coverage (from iframe). You can easily instrument spec files using [babel-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) for example.

Install the plugin

```
npm i -D babel-plugin-istanbul
```

Set your `.babelrc` file

```rc
{
  "plugins": ["istanbul"]
}
```

Put the following in `cypress/plugins/index.js` file to use `.babelrc` file

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/task')(on, config)
  on('file:preprocessor', require('@cypress/code-coverage/use-babelrc'))
  return config
}
```

Now the code coverage from spec files will be combined with end-to-end coverage.

### Alternative for unit tests

If you cannot use `.babelrc` for some reason (maybe it is used by other tools?), try using the Browserify transformer included with this module in `use-browserify-istanbul` file.

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/task')(on, config)
  on(
    'file:preprocessor',
    require('@cypress/code-coverage/use-browserify-istanbul')
  )
  return config
}
```

## Instrument backend code

Example in [examples/backend](examples/backend) folder.

You can also instrument your server-side code and produce combined coverage report that covers both the backend and frontend code

1. Run the server code with instrumentation. The simplest way is to use [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc). If normally you run `node src/server` then to run instrumented version you can do `nyc --silent node src/server`.
2. Add an endpoint that returns collected coverage. If you are using Express, you can simply do

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
require('@cypress/code-coverage/middleware/express')(app)
```

**Tip:** you can register the endpoint only if there is global code coverage object, and you can exclude the middleware code from the coverage numbers

```js
// https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md
/* istanbul ignore next */
if (global.__coverage__) {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/middleware/express')(app)
}
```

If you use Hapi server, define the endpoint yourself and return the object

```js
if (global.__coverage__) {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/middleware/hapi')(server)
}
```

For any other server, define the endpoint yourself and return the coverage object:

```js
if (global.__coverage__) {
  // add method "GET /__coverage__" and response with JSON
  onRequest = response => response.sendJSON({ coverage: global.__coverage__ })
}
```

3. Save the API coverage endpoint in `cypress.json` file to let the plugin know where to call to receive the code coverage data from the server. Place it in `env.codeCoverage` object:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "codeCoverage": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/__coverage__"
    }
  }
}
```

That should be enough - the code coverage from the server will be requested at the end of the test run and merged with the client-side code coverage, producing a combined report.

## Custom report folder

You can specify custom report folder by adding `nyc` object to the `package.json` file. For example to save reports to `cypress-coverage` folder, use:

```json
{
  "nyc": {
    "report-dir": "cypress-coverage"
  }
}
```

## Custom reporters

You can specify custom coverage reporter(s) to use. For example to output text summary and save JSON report in `cypress-coverage` folder set in your `package.json` folder:

```json
{
  "nyc": {
    "report-dir": "cypress-coverage",
    "reporter": ["text", "json"]
  }
}
```

**Tip:** find list of reporters [here](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/)

## Custom NYC command

Sometimes NYC tool might be installed in a different folder not in the current or parent folder, or you might want to customize the report command. In that case, put the custom command into `package.json` in the current folder and this plugin will automatically use it.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "coverage:report": "call NYC report ..."
  }
}
```

## TypeScript users

TypeScript source files should be automatically included in the report, if they are instrumented.

See [examples/ts-example](examples/ts-example), [bahmutov/cra-ts-code-coverage-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cra-ts-code-coverage-example) or [bahmutov/cypress-angular-coverage-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-angular-coverage-example).

## Exclude code

You can exclude parts of the code or entire files from the code coverage report. See [Istanbul guide](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md). Common cases:

### Exclude "else" branch

When running code only during Cypress tests, the "else" branch will never be hit. Thus we should exclude it from the branch coverage computation:

```js
// expose "store" reference during tests
/* istanbul ignore else */
if (window.Cypress) {
  window.store = store
}
```

### Exclude next logical statement

Often needed to skip a statement

```js
/* istanbul ignore next */
if (global.__coverage__) {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/middleware/express')(app)
}
```

Or a particular `switch` case

```js
switch (foo) {
  case 1 /* some code */:
    break
  /* istanbul ignore next */
  case 2: // really difficult to hit from tests
    someCode()
}
```

### Exclude files and folders

See [`nyc` configuration](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#common-configuration-options) and [ include and exclude options](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#using-include-and-exclude-arrays). You can include and exclude files using `minimatch` patterns in `.nycrc` file or using "nyc" object inside your `package.json` file.

For example, if you want to only include files in the `app` folder, but exclude `app/util.js` file, you can set in your `package.json`

```json
{
  "nyc": {
    "include": ["app/**/*.js"],
    "exclude": ["app/util.js"]
  }
}
```

**Note:** if you have `all: true` NYC option set, this plugin will check the produced `.nyc_output/out.json` before generating the final report. If the `out.json` file does not have information for some files that should be there according to `include` list, then an empty placeholder will be included, see [PR 208](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage/pull/208).

Another important option is `excludeAfterRemap`. By default it is false, which might let excluded files through. If you are excluding the files, and the instrumenter does not respect the `nyc.exclude` setting, then add `excludeAfterRemap: true` to tell `nyc report` to exclude files. See [examples/exclude-files](examples/exclude-files).

## Disable plugin

You can skip the client-side code coverage hooks by setting the environment variable `coverage` to `false`.

```shell
cypress run --env coverage=false
```

See [Cypress environment variables](https://on.cypress.io/environment-variables) and [support.js](support.js). You can try running without code coverage in this project yourself

```shell
# run with code coverage
npm run dev
# disable code coverage
npm run dev:no:coverage
```

## Migrations

### v2 to v3

Change the plugins file `cypress/plugins/index.js`

```js
// BEFORE
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', require('@cypress/code-coverage/task'))
}
// AFTER
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('@cypress/code-coverage/task')(on, config)
  // IMPORTANT to return the config object
  // with the any changed environment variables
  return config
}
```

**Tip:** we include [plugins.js](plugins.js) file you can point at from your code in simple cases. From your `cypress.json` file:

```json
{
  "pluginsFile": "node_modules/@cypress/code-coverage/plugins",
  "supportFile": "node_modules/@cypress/code-coverage/support"
}
```

See [examples/use-plugins-and-support](examples/use-plugins-and-support)

## Debugging

This plugin uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module to output additional logging messages from its [task.js](task.js) file. This can help with debugging errors while saving code coverage or reporting. In order to see these messages, run Cypress from the terminal with environment variable `DEBUG=code-coverage`. Example using Unix syntax to set the variable:

```shell
$ DEBUG=code-coverage npm run dev
...
  code-coverage reset code coverage in interactive mode +0ms
  code-coverage wrote coverage file /code-coverage/.nyc_output/out.json +28ms
  code-coverage saving coverage report using command: "nyc report --report-dir ./coverage --reporter=lcov --reporter=clover --reporter=json" +3ms
```

Common issue: [not instrumenting your application when running Cypress](#instrument-your-application).

If the plugin worked before in version X, but stopped after upgrading to version Y, please try the [released versions](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage/releases) between X and Y to see where the breaking change was.

If you decide to open an issue in this repository, please fill all information the [issue template](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) asks. The issues most likely to be resolved have debug logs, screenshots and hopefully public repository links so we can try running the tests ourselves.

## Contributing

You can test changes locally by running tests and confirming the code coverage has been calculated and saved.

```shell
npm run test:ci
# now check generated coverage numbers
npx nyc report --check-coverage true --lines 80
npx nyc report --check-coverage true --lines 100 --include cypress/about.js
npx nyc report --check-coverage true --lines 100 --include cypress/unit.js
```

**Tip:** use [check-code-coverage](https://github.com/bahmutov/check-code-coverage) for stricter code coverage checks than `nyc report --check-coverage` allows.

### Markdown

You can validate links in Markdown files in this directory by executing (Linux + Mac only) script

```shell
npm run check:markdown
```
